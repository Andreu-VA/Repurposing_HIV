# Repurposing_HIV
Machine Learning classification and prediction of chemical substances as drug candidates for HIV (active/inactive).

This my Machine Learning project for a bootcamp on data science that I am enroled. This is my first machine learning approach and I tried to combine it with my PhD in Chemistry expertise, so this project consists on the development of a machine learning model that aims to predict chemical substances active towards HIV based on chemical descripture and structure fingerprints.

You can find a project summary notebook in src/project_resume, plus notebooks for each step of the project (data analysis, data pre-processing, machine learning tuning, etc.)

Finally, once the model was optimized, I tested the model with a "real-life" example, which is a Drug Repurpose database that aims to find a new application to already available and approved drugs and chemicals.
